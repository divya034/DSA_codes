Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a
program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development
and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below :


‚óè Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its
functions. Class is the only logical representation of the data. For
example, Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its
properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as
functions. The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an
object is instantiated.
  
C++ Syntax (for class):
class student{
public:
int id; 
int mobile;
string name;
int add(int x, int y){
return x + y;
}
};


Object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can
represent a person, place or any other item. An object can operate on
both data members and member functions.
  
  
  C++ Syntax (for object):
student s = new student();
Note : When an object is created using a new keyword, then space is
allocated for the variable in a heap, and the starting address is stored in
the stack memory. When an object is created without a new keyword,
then space is not allocated in the heap memory, and the object contains
the null value in the stack.
  
  
  Inheritance
Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and
behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse,
extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other
classes.
In C++
, the class which inherits the members of another class is called
derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class.
The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.
